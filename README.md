# Responsive app from design file.
This was one of the earliest projects I did when first getting started with Lambda School. This was the project where I realized web development was something I could do. It's a very simple project, but it's nice to see where you came from and how much things have improved.

The idea behind this app was to practice CSS skills on more than viewport size. It was super nice getting a chance to see how much I could do in just CSS, LESS, and HTML considering I had only been learning them for such a short time. Making it responsive was a bit of a challenge at first but it felt really good to actually be able to do it in a day. 

It's just a single page I built from scratch from design files.

# Tech Used
HTML5, CSS, LESS
